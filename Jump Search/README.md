# Jump Search - Implementation
This algorithm iterates through a sorted collection of elements by jumping ahead by fixed 
number of steps [n^(1/2)] until the element compared is greater than the one searched.
Then it will perform a linear search until it found the required number.
If it is not found,then it returns -1.
